This is the third and most recent film of the same title and rough storyline. Great action movie with Denzel Washington and John Travolta. The action was well paced, and the NYC subway system is a great set to have a hostage negotiation film. Travolta feels like a loose cannon, and Denzel's character is very believable. There's a scene near the end where Turturro gives Denzel a thumbs up that felt a _bit_ cheesy (I laughed).

The directory, Tony Scott, directed *another* train movie also starring Denzel Washington that came out less than 18 months later ("Unstoppable").
