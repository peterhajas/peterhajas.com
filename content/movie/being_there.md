A film about a simpleton who climbs the social through metaphor and platitudes. Peter Sellars is excellent in it, and the film has great pacing. This movie was very funny. The humor is witty and well-timed. Melvyn Douglas plays a great dying aristocrat.

Fun trivia I learned about this movie: there's an outtake of Sellars shown during the credits that he disliked being in the film. He thought he lost the Oscar due to its inclusion.
