Haunting film about a woman who descends into madness due to an "environmental illness". I found the film haunting. The long shots really added to the suspense and eerie feeling. Carol feels so distant and alone. I loved the 90's aesthetic and furniture.

Fun trivia I learned about this movie: the director intentionally kept the shots wide to increase the emotional distance from the characters.

A friend pointed out that this has strange parallels to modern psychosomatic ailments.
