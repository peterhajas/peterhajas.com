A classic action film. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars alongside the late Carl Weathers. I didn't know that Arnold's famous "get to the chopper" line was from this film. The effects weren't terrible, and it kept mostly away from jump scares. The "Predator vision" thermal effects were cool.

I learned that Kevin Peter Hall, who portrayed the Predator, could not see in the suit and had to memorize where he was walking.
