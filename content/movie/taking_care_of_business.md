I discovered this movie in a search on Wikipedia for the term "Filofax". The [Filofax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filofax) is a personal organizer binder (an oldschool [hipster PDA](https://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda)). The core plot of this film is a businessman losing his Filofax to an escaped convict (played by James Belushi) who lives the high life.

I found this movie to be fun - an 80s comedy that hit all the notes. It was wild to see Gates McFadden and John de Lancie in a movie together (outside of Star Trek: The Next Generation).

This movie also showed me the expansive Filofax community. There are [Filofax blogs](https://philofaxy.blogspot.com), YouTube videos, and more. I think that the film licensed the brand - it was called "Filofax" in its UK release (Filofax is a UK company).
