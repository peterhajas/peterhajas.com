This was a great movie. Entertaining and engaging, the plot had some great Oceans-esque misdirection. Gene Hackman is a convincing about-to-retire thief. Delroy Lindo gave a great performance. Sam Rockwell does a great job as the deadbeat nephew of Danny Devito (this was a hard casting choice to believe). My favorite character was Ricky Jay's - he cleans up messes (even if that means jumping in front of cars).

Fun trivia I learned about this movie: the director (David Mamet) cast his wife (Rebecca Pidgeon, who is great in the roll) in it.
