My Denzel kick continues. Great movie. Creepy and well acted. Denzel Washington plays his role perfectly as Marco. Meryl Streep is a terrifying combination of 21st century American Deep State politicians. I only wish Jon Voight and Jeffrey Wright were onscreen for longer.

Tina Sinatra co-produced this movie, which provides continuity with the original. Marco and Shaw's characters are also largely reused.
