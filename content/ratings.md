title: "Ratings"
---

When rating [movies](/movies) or other media, I try to follow a consistent set of rules.

My brother has a good rating system that I use:

1. Could not finish.
2. Can finish but would never want to again.
3. Pleasant. Would enjoy in future but wouldn't be missed if it didn't happen again.
4. Very enjoyable. Would seek out again. Might recommend.
5. Great. Must experience again. Would recommend.
