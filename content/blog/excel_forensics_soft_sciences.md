I love stories about Microsoft Excel, especially when they involve scientific misconduct. From [Data Colada](http://datacolada.org/109) (via [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/06/excel-data-forensics.html)):

> Two different people independently faked data for two different studies in a paper about dishonesty.

They found evidence *in the Excel document*:

> A little known fact about Excel files is that they are literal zip files, bundles of smaller files that Excel combines to produce a single spreadsheet
...
> CalcChain tells Excel in which order to carry out the calculations in the spreadsheet
...
> Analyses of calcChain for the 5 other out-of-sequence observations similarly support the hypothesis that an analyst (manually) moved observations from one condition to the other. Click the links below to see them

I am suspicious of modern published research in "soft" fields like these. A social psychologist and 269 co-authors repeated studies where they were unable to replicate [more than half](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac4716?siteid=sci&keytype=ref&ijkey=1xgFoCnpLswpk) of the results from 98 papers found in psychology journals. The rates of hypothesis acceptance in "softer" fields [is unsurprisingly higher than in other disciplines](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010068&type=printable).
