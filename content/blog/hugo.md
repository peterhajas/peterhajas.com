I've switched this blog to use [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I got frustrated with my existing static site generator, and wanted something easier to extend.

This took an evening to do. I wrote a fun macro to port all my old PT-dates into nicely formatted ones, redid the frontmatter, and updated the CSS. The site should be functional - please [let me know](/about) if you find any dead links.

I apologize to existing readers whose RSS feed may have duplicate posts.
