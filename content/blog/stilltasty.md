I love websites that are great expressions of the medium. Many of my favorites do one thing well. One of my favorite sites is [www.stilltasty.com](https://www.stilltasty.com). It has a simple purpose:

> How long will your favorite food or beverage stay safe and tasty? What's the best way to store it?

For packaged foods, manufacturers often put expiration dates on them, but [how do they know the _exact date_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qguDBXXOsWw)?

I use this site while shopping or preparing meals. Here are some sample links:

- [How long can you keep bananas in the freezer?](https://www.stilltasty.com/fooditems/index/16451)?
- What's the preservation time for [shelf stable almond milk](https://www.stilltasty.com/Fooditems/index/19075) versus the [refrigerated version](https://www.stilltasty.com/Fooditems/index/19067)?
