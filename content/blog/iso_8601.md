I *really like* ISO 8601. When I was in school, we learned the MM/DD/YYYY date formatting scheme:

`04/03/2024`

This is a strange choice. It's written out of order in terms of the size of each date component (medium, small, large). The DD/MM/YYYY system is slightly better:

`03/04/2024`

Unfortunately, it's confusing with the MM/DD/YYYY system (is that April 3rd, or March 4th?) and in the wrong order (it goes small, medium, large). And what's with the slashes?

[ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) solves all this. An ISO 8601 date looks like this:

`2024-04-03`

There's no ambiguity here. It's large, medium, small. There are no pesky slashes to mess with your file naming scheme. You can alphabetically sort a list of them trivially to order ascending or descending, too.
