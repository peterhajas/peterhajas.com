I have [written](/blog/peterometer_1_hydration) a [lot](/blog/peterometer_2a_eggs) about [logging](/blog/peterometer) food and drinks. I've decided to take a break.

Logging food and drink no longer causes me joy. I don't do analytics on the data, and it feels like a burden to be using my phone so much. I'd obsess about the calories eaten, and hoard them like a resource. I also started to find it to be unfulfilling and futile. Will I still be logging food if I make it to 50? I don't think my life is defined by a CSV file (well, at least not one I've got write permissions to).

If anyone's interested, I'd be happy to share CSV files of ~5 years of food and drink logging. Send me an email if you'd like this data.
