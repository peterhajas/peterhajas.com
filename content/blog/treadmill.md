Early last year, I got a treadmill[^thisone] that I can easily roll under my desk.

The treadmill is great. When I'm feeling ambitious, I wake up a few hours earlier (it helps to go to bed a few hours earlier) and hop on the treadmill. I throw on my headphones to stream [soma.fm's "The Trip"](https://somafm.com/thetrip/).

Then I use the computer. I program, write in my wiki, or surf the web. Soon, 2 hours has elapsed and I've burned 600 active calories.

[^thisone]: [This is the treadmill](https://www.amazon.com/RHYTHM-FUN-Treadmill-Folding-Portable/dp/B07V7F8QYK) I got. No endorsement besides "It still works 11 months later after moderate use".
