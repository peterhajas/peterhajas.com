I read today that [Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter) is [going offline](https://nitter.d420.de/) due to changes at The X Platform blocking the service.

This is unfortunate. Nitter is a pillar of an alternate internet, not powered and funded by surveillance and megabytes of scripts. I like it so much that I have a [clipboard watcher](https://github.com/peterhajas/dotfiles/blob/master/hammerspoon/.hammerspoon/link_replace.lua) on my computer (and a Shortcut on my phone / pad) to do replacement so I can use a Nitter instance.

I'll miss Nitter. Thanks for all the fast pageloads and low distraction. I've removed nitter from the [Internet Independence](/internet_independence) page.
