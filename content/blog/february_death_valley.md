In February, I had the opportunity to go on a trip to [Death Valley National Park](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley_National_Park) with some friends. It was an awesome time! Here’s what happened:

# Gear

I was lucky enough to go to REI with one of my buddies, a camping veteran, before the trip. He was also the organizer of our trip to Death Valley. At REI, I secured some supplies, including essentials (sleeping bag, freeze-dried food), things I thought were unnecessary but ended up being very useful (utensils, sleeping pad), and things I had no idea you needed or wanted on a camping trip (pillow, chair). It helps to go with people who are experienced!

# The Trip Out

We left at an early 5AM towards our destination. The Death Valley area is a good 6-7 hours from the Bay Area. The drive was pretty, complete with an early morning coffee pit stop in Gilroy. Onwards...

# Campsite One: The Trona Pinnacles

We arrived in our first campsite: the [Trona Pinnacles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trona_Pinnacles). This area looks like another planet:

In fact, it’s been used for just that in movie and TV sets (Star Trek V was filmed here). It was also the setting for [Lady Gaga’s latest video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5L6xyaeiV58).

This is also where fighter jets do test flights, which is really cool to see up close:

The area is part of [California’s BLM lands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Land_Management). This made it a great spot for camping and for a fire.

Along with some Ardbeg, I enjoyed some a delicious freeze dried meal: chili macaroni and cheese with beef.

# Campsite Two: In The Park

After a nice oatmeal and some instant coffee, we pushed off to [Trona, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trona,_San_Bernardino_County,_California) to stock up on some snacks and get gas. Trona is an industrial town in the middle of nowhere. My fiancé and I fell in love with it on our first visit. They mine borax and salt. I love this note from the [Trona High School Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trona_High_School):

> Until several years ago an annual game was played against Boron High School. Referred to as the Borax Bowl by some, the game was a matchup of two mining towns that are world leaders in producing potash and borax, minerals used in a number of products.

While in Trona, we saw a motorcycle group with a dog that rode along. Cool!

We took off to enter Death Valley. Rather than entering through the visitor center from California, we took a side route. We saw some amazing sites on the way in to the park:

I even saw an abandoned mineshaft - cool!

We then arrived at our next camp site. We set up our tents, and imbibed and ate.

The night was a bit windy, but the tent I was loaned stood up just fine after some rocks were placed inside.

# Campsite Three: Echo Canyon

We awoke, had some breakfast, and pushed off. We stopped off at some abandoned campgrounds and checked out a cool natural spring:

We headed off to [Beatty, NV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatty,_Nevada) for a stop at a diner:

We had to make a game-time decision about where to stay on this third night. We had thought of staying that night in a canyon, but the park was experiencing snow (in a desert no less):

I was *really* hoping we would not have to call off our trip a day early. We decided to stay the night - I was happy we did - and headed off to Echo Canyon.

Inside the canyon, we found a nice campsite against some rocks:

We pitched our tents, and had dinner for the evening.

As the night wore on, the wind picked up more and more. I awoke at around 4 in the morning to the wall of the tent covering my body, pushed by a strong wind. I figured I wouldn’t suffocate (I was getting barraged by oxygen), so I went back to bed.

# The Trip Back

The next morning, after our customary breakfast, we packed up and headed back to civilization. We saw some beautiful views on our way out:

We stopped at a truck stop for some food. I had a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese - it was delicious.

All in all, a great trip! I hope to get back soon.
