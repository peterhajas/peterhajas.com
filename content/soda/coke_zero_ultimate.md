I love trying new sodas. My wife recently found [Coca-ColaÂ® Zero Sugar Ultimate](https://us.coca-cola.com/products/coke-creations/league-of-legends-ultimate-limited-edition-soda-zero-sugar) at the store. It's good! It tastes like a bit of a berry-infused Coca-Cola Zero (but definitely not like any of Coca-Cola's cherry flavors). The marketing for this product centers around it being the "+XP" flavor.

It kind of tastes like gaining experience points in a game. It's nice to enjoy a product featuring aspartame in the aftermath of a declaration about [how bad it may be for you](https://www.who.int/news/item/14-07-2023-aspartame-hazard-and-risk-assessment-results-released). I think this really *does* make it the "Ultimate" Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.

I look forward to more Coke Creations products!
