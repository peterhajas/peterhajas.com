I love Pok√©mon. My fascination with the series began with the original games released in the US, Pok√©mon Red and Blue (I had the Blue version).

In the past few years, people have been disassembling Pok√©mon games. You can check these out for Pok√©mon [Red and Blue](https://github.com/pret/pokered), [Crystal](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal), [Emerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald), and others. It's really cool to be able to compile and build a game that was such a huge part of my youth.

I thought it would be fun to play with this source code, viewing these games through a new lens. A few months ago, I discovered [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org), a software package for rendering graphs written in the [Dot language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)). Dot is a very simple language, and it's easy to filter data into its format. Graphviz includes some command line tools that can render dot files to nice human-readable output. Let's see how we can use Graphviz to visualize Pok√©mon Red and Blue.

Inside of `pokered`, there's a `data` directory with a `mapHeaders` subdirectory inside. `mapHeaders` includes metadata about every overworld map in the game. This includes the connections between maps. For example, here is the metadata for Route 10:

    $ cat Route10.asm 
    Route10_h:
        db OVERWORLD ; tileset
        db ROUTE_10_HEIGHT, ROUTE_10_WIDTH ; dimensions (y, x)
        dw Route10_Blocks ; blocks
        dw Route10_TextPointers ; texts
        dw Route10_Script ; scripts
        db SOUTH | WEST ; connections
        SOUTH_MAP_CONNECTION ROUTE_10, LAVENDER_TOWN, 0, 0, LavenderTown_Blocks
        WEST_MAP_CONNECTION ROUTE_10, ROUTE_9, 0, 0, Route9_Blocks
        dw Route10_Object ; objects

So south of Route 10 is Lavender Town, and west is Route 9. We can use this connection data and some simple uses of `grep` and `awk` to generate Dot code representing these connections. The following commands are all run from `/data/mapHeaders` in the `pokered` repository. First, we use `grep` to see the connections:

    $ grep -R "MAP_CONNECTION" ./
    .//PewterCity.asm:	SOUTH_MAP_CONNECTION PEWTER_CITY, ROUTE_2, 5, 0, Route2_Blocks
    .//PewterCity.asm:	EAST_MAP_CONNECTION PEWTER_CITY, ROUTE_3, 4, 0, Route3_Blocks
    ...
Next, let's pipe that to `awk` to print the endpoints of that connection:

    $ grep -R "MAP_CONNECTION" ./ | awk -F" " '{ print $3 $4; }'
    PEWTER_CITY,ROUTE_2,
    PEWTER_CITY,ROUTE_3,
    ...

We can use a second `awk` invocation to print these as Dot edges:

    $ grep -R "MAP_CONNECTION" ./ | awk -F" " '{ print $3 $4; }' | awk -F"," '{ print $1" -- "$2 }'
    PEWTER_CITY -- ROUTE_2
    PEWTER_CITY -- ROUTE_3
    ...

Undirected Dot edges are represented with the two nodes and a `--` between them.

We can represent a strict (one connection between nodes) graph (non-directed, as these are bidirectional connections) by wrapping all these connections in a `strict graph {}`:

    strict graph {
        PEWTER_CITY -- ROUTE_2
        PEWTER_CITY -- ROUTE_3
        ...

We can add two other options (`overlap=false` to avoid edge overlap and `splines=true` to use splines for edges) to get a better looking graph. Here's my `pokemon_rb_towns_and_routes.dot` generated from the above steps:

    strict graph {
        overlap=false;
        splines=true;
        PEWTER_CITY -- ROUTE_2
        PEWTER_CITY -- ROUTE_3

        CINNABAR_ISLAND -- ROUTE_20
        ROUTE_1 -- VIRIDIAN_CITY
        ROUTE_1 -- PALLET_TOWN
    }

We can use a simple invocation of `neato` to produce a PDF file with:

    neato -Tpdf pokemon_rb_towns_and_routes.dot > pokemon_rb_towns_and_routes.pdf

Check it out:

![A graph visualizing all towns and routes in Pok√©mon Red and Blue](/media/pokemon_rb_towns_and_routes_preview.png)
([PDF file here](/media/pokemon_rb_towns_and_routes.pdf))

OK, so towns and routes are cool. Can we augment this file to include buildings, tunnels, and rooms? There are `warp` and `warp_to` markers in the files in `/data/mapObjects`. For example, let's look at `SaffronCity.asm`:

    $ cat data/mapObjects/SaffronCity.asm
    SaffronCity_Object:
        db $f ; border block

        db 8 ; warps
        warp 7, 5, 0, COPYCATS_HOUSE_1F
        warp 26, 3, 0, FIGHTING_DOJO
        warp 34, 3, 0, SAFFRON_GYM
        warp 13, 11, 0, SAFFRON_PIDGEY_HOUSE
        warp 25, 11, 0, SAFFRON_MART
        warp 18, 21, 0, SILPH_CO_1F
        warp 9, 29, 0, SAFFRON_POKECENTER
        warp 29, 29, 0, MR_PSYCHICS_HOUSE

        ...

        ; warp-to
        warp_to 7, 5, SAFFRON_CITY_WIDTH ; COPYCATS_HOUSE_1F
        warp_to 26, 3, SAFFRON_CITY_WIDTH ; FIGHTING_DOJO
        warp_to 34, 3, SAFFRON_CITY_WIDTH ; SAFFRON_GYM
        warp_to 13, 11, SAFFRON_CITY_WIDTH ; SAFFRON_PIDGEY_HOUSE
        warp_to 25, 11, SAFFRON_CITY_WIDTH ; SAFFRON_MART
        warp_to 18, 21, SAFFRON_CITY_WIDTH ; SILPH_CO_1F
        warp_to 9, 29, SAFFRON_CITY_WIDTH ; SAFFRON_POKECENTER
        warp_to 29, 29, SAFFRON_CITY_WIDTH ; MR_PSYCHICS_HOUSE

        ...

(These `_WIDTH` suffixes seem to indicate the coordinates are inside of the width of the map. We'll clean them up later.)

So, if we parse out the `warp_to` statements, we should be able to get a more complete view of the game's locations and how they connect. Let's start with a simple `grep` to find all the `warp_to` statements (run from `/data/mapObjects`):

    grep -R "warp_to " ./
    .//RocketHideoutB4F.asm:	warp_to 19, 10, ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B3F
    .//RocketHideoutB4F.asm:	warp_to 24, 15, ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_ELEVATOR
    .//RocketHideoutB4F.asm:	warp_to 25, 15, ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_ELEVATOR
    ...

Next, pipe to `awk` to find the endpoints of the warp:

    $ grep -R "warp_to " ./ | awk -F"," '{ print $3; }'
    ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B3F
    ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_ELEVATOR
    ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_ELEVATOR
    CELADON_MART_3F_WIDTH ; CELADON_MART_4F
    CELADON_MART_3F_WIDTH ; CELADON_MART_2F
    CELADON_MART_3F_WIDTH ; CELADON_MART_ELEVATOR
    BRUNOS_ROOM_WIDTH ; LORELEIS_ROOM
    BRUNOS_ROOM_WIDTH ; LORELEIS_ROOM
    BRUNOS_ROOM_WIDTH ; AGATHAS_ROOM
    BRUNOS_ROOM_WIDTH ; AGATHAS_ROOM
    BIKE_SHOP_WIDTH
    ...

This is close, but includes some warps that appear to point to themselves (like `BIKE_SHOP_WIDTH` above). No problem - we can only print lines with `;` in them using `grep`:

    $ grep -R "warp_to " ./ | awk -F"," '{ print $3; }' | grep ";"
    ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B3F
    ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_ELEVATOR
    ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F_WIDTH ; ROCKET_HIDEOUT_ELEVATOR
    CELADON_MART_3F_WIDTH ; CELADON_MART_4F
    CELADON_MART_3F_WIDTH ; CELADON_MART_2F
    CELADON_MART_3F_WIDTH ; CELADON_MART_ELEVATOR
    ...

OK, almost done. Next, let's strip out the `_WIDTH` text and put in edge connections:

    $ grep -R "warp_to " ./ | awk -F"," '{ print $3; }' | grep ";" | sed -e "s/_WIDTH//" | sed -e "s/;/--/"
     ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F -- ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B3F
     ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F -- ROCKET_HIDEOUT_ELEVATOR
     ROCKET_HIDEOUT_B4F -- ROCKET_HIDEOUT_ELEVATOR
     CELADON_MART_3F -- CELADON_MART_4F
     CELADON_MART_3F -- CELADON_MART_2F
     CELADON_MART_3F -- CELADON_MART_ELEVATOR
    ...

(note the leading space here - not a big deal for the Graphviz tools)

Now, we'll put this all into a `pokemon_rb_all.dot` file (along with the connections from `pokemon_rb_towns_and_routes.dot`) to make a graph of all of the locations in Pok√©mon Red and Blue. For this invocation, I also used `neato`:

    neato -Tpdf pokemon_rb_all.dot > pokemon_rb_all.pdf

This graph is so cool! Check it out:

![A graph visualizing all locations in Pok√©mon Red and Blue](/media/pokemon_rb_all_preview.png)
([PDF file here](/media/pokemon_rb_all.pdf), [dot file here](/media/pokemon_rb_all.dot))

There are so many sections of this graph with interesting details, like Victory Road leading into the Indigo Plateau and Elite Four:

![A cropped version of the "all locations" graph showing just Victory Road, the Indigo Plateau, and the Elite Four sections of the graph](/media/pokemon_rb_all_e4.png)

Or the maze-like Silph Company building:

![A cropped version of the "all locations" graph showing just the Silph Company building floors](/media/pokemon_rb_all_silph.png)

I think it's really cool how easy it is to use simple tools to see these games from a new angle. I hope to look at other aspects of these games sometime in the future.
