In the film Office Space, there's a great montage to ["Damn It Feels Good To Be A Gangsta"](https://music.apple.com/us/album/damn-it-feels-good-to-be-a-gangsta/710128784?i=710130888). There's a version of that montage [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1L8l3LrzLA).

There's something interesting in this montage, around [the 1:04 mark](https://youtu.be/I1L8l3LrzLA?t=64). Near the right side of the screen:

It's a Nintendo 64!

Right at the edge of the frame is part of a cartridge. Because of cropping, we can't tell what game is in the console in the standard-definition version of the film.

Very thankfully, in the [widescreen version of the movie](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/office-space/umc.cmc.6jlilk9yf1ozlv281w6rnw5pu), we can more clearly see what Game Pak is in the console:

Let's enhance a bit more:

It's Mario Kart 64!

As we see later on in the film, the controller is plugged into Player 4's port:
