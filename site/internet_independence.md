Title: Internet Independence

This is a page with some tips and tricks for being more independent on the internet.

# Independence for stuff you consume

The internet has all sorts of stuff to consume. For example:

- news sites
- aggregator sites (Reddit, Hacker News)
- social media sites
- video sites

Thankfully, you can subscribe to all of these with feeds!

## The Power of Feeds

Feeds are a neat way to subscribe to content on the web. You can subscribe to a site in your [feed reader](https://www.youneedfeeds.com/web-based) and get updates from it. This way, when you want to check on things, you only need to open your feed reader. This also lets you avoid many forms of tracking.

Under the hood, "Atom" and "RSS" are the dominant feed standards on the web. [You can read more about feeds on this page](https://aboutfeeds.com).

### Sites that Support Feeds

Most sites support feeds out of the box. For example, if you want to read posts from [Slashdot](https://slashdot.org), you can subscribe to their [RSS feed](http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdotMain) and read posts in your feed reader.

### Other Sites

Not all sites support feeds out of the box, but there is usually a way to subscribe. For example, you can use [RSSHub](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub) or [rss-bridge](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge) to get feeds for other sites.

# Independence for stuff you produce

It's also fun to share stuff with your friends, family, and the world.

## Get a Website

You should [get a website](/blog/get_a_website.html)! It's nice to put your stuff on a platform you control. You can put your writing, your photos, and other stuff you want to share on your own website.

Once you've gotten a website, it's a good idea to publish your content with feeds. This lets people subscribe using their feed reader. Your website might already support feeds depending on how it is configured (like if you're using Wordpress, Jekyll, or Hyde). If not, you can check out the [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) and [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) standards on Wikipedia and try your hand at generating your own. This site generates its own RSS feed.
