Title: September 2020 Site Updates
Date: 20200908 22:00

I've made a few updates to the site that I wanted to write about:

1. There is a new [Internet Independence](/internet_independence.html) section which has some helpful tips for being more independent online.
2. I added a [Cool Sites](/cool_sites.html) page with links to cool sites. Please check it out. If you operate a site that is cool, email me and I will consider adding it.
3. I made a [Pix](/notes/index.php) site with a feed of photos that I update occasionally.

I hope you like these changes to the site.
