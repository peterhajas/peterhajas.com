Watched [this documentary about Ulillillia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFLJEIrfx9U), the internet figure. It follows him and the small town of Minot, ND in the aftermath of the [2011 Souris River Flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Souris_River_flood). Despite it being from 2012, it was released at the end of 2019.

While the film moved at a slower pace, I found some of Ulillillia's quotes from it interesting. In the documentary, Ulillillia lives with his parents:

> There's very little I can do, so I don't get much enjoyment ... I definitely wish I could travel more, or see the world ... it's like I can't get out of the cage

[According to this wiki page](https://ulillillia.fandom.com/wiki/Ulillillia), he has since gotten a driver's license and moved out of his parent's home to Florida.
