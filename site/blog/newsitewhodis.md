Title: New Site, Who Dis?

This is the first post on my new website! You're reading this on the *brand new* [peterhajas.com](http://peterhajas.com). Let's break it down.

# A (not so new) domain

It's worth noting that this page is also hosted on [peter.haj.as](http://peter.haj.as). I have had this domain from American Samoa for some time. I love the idea of domains that are people's names with no added alphanumeric characters, and this one fits the bill for me.

# My own static site generator - what could possibly go wrong?

My old page was powered by [Hyde](https://github.com/hyde/hyde). While this project provides a lot of flexibility, I felt that I was not using all of its features. I wanted something dead-simple that could enable me to write more. As a result, I [wrote my own](https://github.com/peterhajas/peterhajas.com).

This site is still statically-generated from Markdown, but it's now done with a Bash script with only one dependency (a `markdown` binary). This makes it easier to set up on a new machine. It also lets me really understand how the site works.

The site generates quickly, and it's been a great learning opportunity! For example, I learned how to format dates using `date` (see [here](https://github.com/peterhajas/peterhajas.com/blob/master/build#L44)). I'm still learning (I don't know web layout very well, for example) but I think it's better to jump in with both feet when learning something new.

The site is missing some stuff (like RSS support), but I plan to iterate on it over time.

# Hopefully I'll write more

All of this is for naught if I don't actually *use the damn thing* to write and think out loud.

I hadn't updated my old webpage in **over 6 years**. There's so much that has happened in that time that I want to write about, like:

- I have a dog!
- Living in the Bay Area
- My obsession with [dotfiles](https://github.com/peterhajas/dotfiles)
- Music that I'm listening to
- Trips I've gone on
- Pictures I've taken

Fingers crossed I'll write about these things in the (near) future on this page.
