<p>In February, I had the opportunity to go on a trip to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley_National_Park">Death Valley National Park</a> with some friends. It was an awesome time! Here’s what happened:</p>
<h1 id="gear">Gear</h1>
<p>I was lucky enough to go to REI with one of my buddies, a camping veteran, before the trip. He was also the organizer of our trip to Death Valley. At REI, I secured some supplies, including essentials (sleeping bag, freeze-dried food), things I thought were unnecessary but ended up being very useful (utensils, sleeping pad), and things I had no idea you needed or wanted on a camping trip (pillow, chair). It helps to go with people who are experienced!</p>
<h1 id="the-trip-out">The Trip Out</h1>
<p>We left at an early 5AM towards our destination. The Death Valley area is a good 6-7 hours from the Bay Area. The drive was pretty, complete with an early morning coffee pit stop in Gilroy. Onwards&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="campsite-one-the-trona-pinnacles">Campsite One: The Trona Pinnacles</h1>
<p>We arrived in our first campsite: the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trona_Pinnacles">Trona Pinnacles</a>. This area looks like another planet:</p>
<p><img src="/dv_pinnacles.jpeg" alt="photo I took of Trona Pinnacles"></p>
<p>In fact, it’s been used for just that in movie and TV sets (Star Trek V was filmed here). It was also the setting for <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5L6xyaeiV58">Lady Gaga’s latest video</a>.</p>
<p>This is also where fighter jets do test flights, which is really cool to see up close:</p>
<p><img src="/dv_jet.jpeg" alt="photo I took of fighter jet"></p>
<p>The area is part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Land_Management">California’s BLM lands</a>. This made it a great spot for camping and for a fire.</p>
<p>Along with some Ardbeg, I enjoyed some a delicious freeze dried meal: chili macaroni and cheese with beef.</p>
<h1 id="campsite-two-in-the-park">Campsite Two: In The Park</h1>
<p>After a nice oatmeal and some instant coffee, we pushed off to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trona,_San_Bernardino_County,_California">Trona, CA</a> to stock up on some snacks and get gas. Trona is an industrial town in the middle of nowhere. My fiancé and I fell in love with it on our first visit. They mine borax and salt. I love this note from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trona_High_School">Trona High School Wikipedia page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until several years ago an annual game was played against Boron High School. Referred to as the Borax Bowl by some, the game was a matchup of two mining towns that are world leaders in producing potash and borax, minerals used in a number of products.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While in Trona, we saw a motorcycle group with a dog that rode along. Cool!</p>

<p>We took off to enter Death Valley. Rather than entering through the visitor center from California, we took a side route. We saw some amazing sites on the way in to the park:</p>
<p><img src="/dv_enter.jpeg" alt="photo from Inyokern entering the park"></p>
<p>I even saw an abandoned mineshaft - cool!</p>
<p><img src="/dv_mineshaft.jpeg" alt="photo of abandoned mineshaft"></p>
<p>We then arrived at our next camp site. We set up our tents, and imbibed and ate.</p>
<p>The night was a bit windy, but the tent I was loaned stood up just fine after some rocks were placed inside.</p>
<h1 id="campsite-three-echo-canyon">Campsite Three: Echo Canyon</h1>
<p>We awoke, had some breakfast, and pushed off. We stopped off at some abandoned campgrounds and checked out a cool natural spring:</p>
<p><img src="/dv_spring.jpeg" alt="photo of natural spring"></p>
<p>We headed off to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatty,_Nevada">Beatty, NV</a> for a stop at a diner:</p>
<p><img src="/dv_diner.jpeg" alt="photo of food at diner"></p>
<p>We had to make a game-time decision about where to stay on this third night. We had thought of staying that night in a canyon, but the park was experiencing snow (in a desert no less):</p>
<p><img src="/dv_snow.jpeg" alt="photo of snow"></p>
<p>I was <em>really</em> hoping we would not have to call off our trip a day early. We decided to stay the night - I was happy we did - and headed off to Echo Canyon.</p>
<p>Inside the canyon, we found a nice campsite against some rocks:</p>
<p><img src="/dv_echo.jpeg" alt="photo of campsite in echo canyon"></p>
<p>We pitched our tents, and had dinner for the evening.</p>
<p>As the night wore on, the wind picked up more and more. I awoke at around 4 in the morning to the wall of the tent covering my body, pushed by a strong wind. I figured I wouldn’t suffocate (I was getting barraged by oxygen), so I went back to bed.</p>
<h1 id="the-trip-back">The Trip Back</h1>
<p>The next morning, after our customary breakfast, we packed up and headed back to civilization. We saw some beautiful views on our way out:</p>

<p>We stopped at a truck stop for some food. I had a Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese - it was delicious.</p>
<p>All in all, a great trip! I hope to get back soon.</p>
