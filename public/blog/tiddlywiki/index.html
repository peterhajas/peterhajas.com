<p>I recently learned about <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com">TiddlyWiki</a>. It&rsquo;s wiki software that you run on your computer.</p>
<p>There are lots of these &ldquo;second brain&rdquo; pieces of software - Notion, Obsidian, vimwiki. But TiddlyWiki has some special tricks up its sleeve that I think put it into a league of its own. There are two components of it that I find so intriguing.</p>
<h1 id="it-includes-its-own-viewer-and-editor">It includes its own viewer and editor</h1>
<p>If I were using vimwiki (which I used to, heavily!), I&rsquo;d store all my files on my computer (like in <code>~/.vimwiki</code>, which I had symlinked to my NextCloud instance). But I&rsquo;d need a way to view and edit those files. I used <code>vim</code> and Marked 2. TiddlyWiki is a self-contained HTML file. It has everything in it - the editor, the viewer, a filesystem implementation, but it&rsquo;s all saved to one HTML file. This is very novel - it&rsquo;s the ultimate portability. I can sync one file to copy my entire database, viewing experience and all. I can make copies of to back it up or try new things.</p>
<h1 id="it-is-built-in-itself">It is built in itself</h1>
<p>This TiddlyWiki&rsquo;s superpower. It is a tool that is built inside of itself. Besides a small kernel of core functionality, the rest of the system is represented as &ldquo;tiddlers&rdquo; - individual notes / files. The sidebar menu, the story list of tiddlers, the editor toolbar, <em>all of this</em> is represented as Tiddlers. This makes it very easy to add new functionality to these views. For example, I added an Emoji picker and indicator to all my Tiddlers in a few minutes. This can be done with the embedded powerful template language. TiddlyWiki supports key-value storage (called &ldquo;fields&rdquo;) on tiddlers, enabling you to make your own taxonomy and relationships.</p>
<p>To help you wrap your mind around this concept, here are things that are <em>just tiddlers</em> in TiddlyWiki:</p>
<ul>
<li>the menus and user interface</li>
<li>the stylesheets that customize the UI</li>
<li>the user settings (metrics, themes, behaviors)</li>
<li>the state of the wiki, like open tiddlers</li>
<li>plugins, which can contain JavaScript, CSS, and tiddlers</li>
<li>keyboard shortcuts, including the ability to make your own</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of this UI comes from use of tags, which is just another field on a tiddler. This lets you put things into the system easily. If you want a new item in the sidebar, just tag it with <code>$:/tags/SideBarSegment</code>. If you want something new in the view for each tiddler, tag it with <code>$:/tags/ViewTemplate</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I found this software a few days ago, and I&rsquo;ve already become enamored with it. I think this site might eventually become a TiddlyWiki.</p>
<p>As they say in their <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Discover%2520TiddlyWiki.html">Discover</a> page:</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve never seen anything like TiddlyWiki</p>

<p>I agree - I recommend you <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com">go play with it</a>!</p>
