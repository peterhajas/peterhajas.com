<p>Do you know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonaldland">McDonaldland</a>? It&rsquo;s the fantastical world of fictional characters created by McDonald&rsquo;s. Ronald McDonald, Grimace, Birdie, the Hamburglar, etc. These were staple characters in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>I recently wondered: <em>how large is the McDonaldland universe?</em> Let&rsquo;s explore this question.</p>
<p>Ronald McDonald was in advertisements with a lot of popular characters to promote the McDonald&rsquo;s restaurant. A notable one was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CClLVbJHZZU">this ad</a> where Ronald and Grimace run into Mario, from Super Mario Brothers. This means Mario, Peach, and the Mushroom Kingdom are <em>in the McDonaldland universe</em>. Pretty cool! Let&rsquo;s see how deep this goes.</p>
<p>Mario is a very popular character, and has appeared in games with many other characters. For example, Mario&rsquo;s presence in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_%26_Sonic_at_the_Olympic_Games">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games</a> series. This means the characters of Sonic are also in McDonaldland.</p>
<p>Sonic is also very popular. In 2013, he appeared in the <a href="https://archiesonic.fandom.com/wiki/Worlds_Collide">&ldquo;Worlds Collide&rdquo; Archie comic</a>. This involved a crossover with the Capcom character, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man">Mega Man</a>. This means that Mega Man also resides in McDonaldland.</p>
<p>Capcom pursued some ambitious games with their characters. A popular title was 1998&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_vs._Capcom:_Clash_of_Super_Heroes">Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes</a> where Capcom characters (including the Blue Bomber, Mega Man) appeared alongside Marvel superheroes. All of the Marvel characters (Iron Man, Rogue, Wolverine, etc.) are part of McDonaldland.</p>
<p>Marvel characters haven&rsquo;t just appeared in crossovers with their own properties. There were two comics where the characters of the Marvel universe also met with the crew of the Enterprise from both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek/X-Men">the original series in &ldquo;Star Trek/X-Men&rdquo;</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_X_(Star_Trek)">the Next Generation in &ldquo;Planet X&rdquo;</a>. All of Star Fleet exists in McDonaldland.</p>
<p>The Star Trek characters were in many films, books, and comics. An important one for the McDonaldland continuity was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek/Green_Lantern">&ldquo;Star Trek/Green Lantern&rdquo;</a> series. This involved the crew of the Enterprise meeting the Green Lantern. Unsurprisingly, the DC Comics characters also exist in McDonaldland.</p>
<p>Superman has fought a lot of tough enemies. One of the most difficult was published in the year 2000. He battled against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_vs._The_Terminator:_Death_to_the_Future">The Terminator in &ldquo;Superman vs. The Terminator: Death to the Future&rdquo;</a>. Obviously, Sarah Connor and the Terminator are also from McDonaldland.</p>
<p>There were other comics featuring The Terminator. One put him in the middle of a triangle against two other battling foes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_versus_Predator_versus_The_Terminator">Aliens versus Predator versus The Terminator</a>. This means the characters of &ldquo;Alien&rdquo; (Ripley, Peter Weyland, the alien, and others) are in McDonaldland.</p>
<p>The Alien franchise didn&rsquo;t just feature in the popular films, but also video games. An important title was 2015&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_X">Mortal Kombat X</a>. Here, you could play as Alien and fight Freddy from &ldquo;A Nightmare on Elm Street&rdquo;. Freddy Krueger also exists in McDonaldland.</p>
<p>Freddy Krueger also appeared in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_(2011_video_game)">Mortal Kombat (9)</a> alongside some other characters. The roster included Kratos from God of War, another resident of McDonaldland.</p>
<p>The McDonaldland Multiverse (also called the McDonaldland / Mario / Sonic / Mega Man / Marvel / Star Trek / DC / Terminator / Alien / Nightmare on Elm Street / God of War Multiverse) is an expansive one. To help visualize it, I prepared <a href="/mcdonaldland.dot">this DOT file</a> which you can see here:</p>
